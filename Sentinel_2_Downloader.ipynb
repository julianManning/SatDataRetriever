    " As of 2025, **three satellites** are operational:   \n",
    "\n",
    "- 🚀 **Sentinel-2A** (launched June 23, 2015)  \n",
    "- 🚀 **Sentinel-2B** (launched March 7, 2017)  \n",
    "- 🚀 **Sentinel-2C** (launched September 5, 2024)\n",
    "    \n",
    "A fourth satellite, **Sentinel-2D**, is planned to replace older units in the future.\n",

    "📖 For an official overview of the Sentinel-2 mission, including its objectives, satellite specifications, and applications, visit the [ESA Sentinel-2 mission](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-2). \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧭 High Spatial Resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentinel-2 offers **multi-scale spatial resolution** across its 13 spectral bands: \n",
    "\n",
    "- 🔵 **10 m** – Visible (Blue, Green, Red) and Near-Infrared (NIR)\n",
    "- 🟢 **20 m** – Red-edge and Shortwave Infrared (SWIR)\n",
    "- 🟣 **60 m** – Atmospheric correction bands (e.g., cirrus, water vapor)\n",
    "\n",
    "📖 For detailed information about the Sentinel-2 MSI (Multispectral Instrument), including its spectral bands and spatial resolution, visit the [Sentinel-2 MSI Instrument](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/instruments/sentinel-2-msi).\n",
    "\n",
    "The band composition allows for detailed mapping of vegetation, urban areas, water bodies, and more:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- 🌿 Vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, EVI)\n",
    "- 💧 Water quality and turbidity\n",
    "- 🏜️ Soil moisture and mineral content\n",
    "- 🌫️ Atmospheric correction (e.g., haze, cirrus detection)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔁 Frequent Revisit Intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to its constellation design:\n",
    "- 🕔 **Each satellite** revisits the same location every **10 days**\n",
    "- 🕔 **Combined constellation** (2A + 2B + 2C) achieves a **5-day revisit time** at the equator\n",
    "- 🧊 At higher latitudes, revisit frequency may increases due to orbital overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "This high temporal resolution ensures timely data for dynamic monitoring—especially useful in cloud-prone or rapidly changing environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌫️ Atmospheric Levels\n",
    "Sentinel-2 data is available at different processing levels, each offering a distinct degree of radiometric and geometric correction. You can select the desired level based on your specific needs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Level-1C**:  \n",
    "  🌤️ Top-of-atmosphere reflectance. Includes ortho-rectification and global spatial registration.  \n",
    "  Ideal for aquatic studies or when raw reflectance is preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Level-2A**:  \n",
    "  🌍 Bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance in cartographic geometry. Includes atmospheric, terrain, and cirrus correction.  \n",
    "  Best suited for terrestrial applications requiring accurate surface reflectance.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ Sentinel-2 Downloader Built with Python\n",
    "In this notebook, a **versatile Python tool** is developed to automate the retrieval of multiple Sentinel-2 images from the **Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem** 🌍.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ Why Use the this code?\n",
    "The tool aims to offer flexibility by enabling the selection of different atmospheric correction levels. This simplifies the data acquisition process and ensures that the appropriate imagery is obtained for a wide range of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some QGIS plugins, like **Sentinel 2 Image Downloader**, offer a simple, no-code interface for downloading satellite imagery. This Python-based workflow was developed to support more specific use cases, particularly where logging, automation, and batch processing are more important:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customisable downloads** tailored to specific project needs  \n",
    "- **Integration** with broader data processing workflows  \n",
    "- **Batch processing and automation** for large-scale tasks  \n",
    "- **Download logging** via CSV for tracking and resuming interrupted sessions  \n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ **Note:** This workflow is especially useful when working with unstable internet connections. If a download is interrupted, the process can resume from where it left off using the generated CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, in cases where comparing different baselines is required (see Section 2.2), this method allows downloading multiple versions of the same image—something that may not be supported by plugin-based tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔓 Account Required\n",
    "⚠️ Before you begin, make sure you have an account with the **Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem**.  \n",

    "## 📥 2.2 Download Image (Function)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `download_copernicus_data` function is designed to download satellite imagery data from the Copernicus Open Access Hub. It allows users to specify various parameters such as the data collection, region of interest (ROI), time range, product type, and more. The function can also be configured to download only the latest processed images or all available images within the specified criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💻 Parameters\n",
    "- **data_collection**: The name of the data collection to query (e.g., 'Sentinel-2').\n",
    "- **ROI**: The region of interest (e.g., Shapefile solution or Latitude/Longitude Solution)\n",
    "- **time_begin**: The start date for the data query in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.\n",
    "- **time_end**: The end date for the data query in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.\n",
    "- **copernicus_user**: The username for accessing the Copernicus Open Access Hub.\n",
    "- **copernicus_password**: The password for accessing the Copernicus Open Access Hub.\n",
    "- **product_type**: A list of product types to filter (e.g., `['L1C', 'L2A']`).\n",
    "- **save_folder**: The folder where the downloaded files will be saved.\n",
    "- **download_latest_only**: A boolean flag indicating whether to download only the latest processed images (`True`) or all available images (`False`).\n",
    "- **cert_path**: The path to the SSL certificate file (default is provided by the `certifi` library).\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⬇️ Function Workflow\n",
    "1. **Ensure Save Folder Exists**: The function checks if the specified save folder exists and creates it if it does not.\n",
    "2. **Fetch Data from Copernicus API**: It sends a request to the Copernicus API to fetch available datasets based on the specified parameters.\n",
    "3. **Convert Response to DataFrame**: The JSON response from the API is converted into a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "4. **Filter Data**: The function filters the data based on the specified product types (`L1C` or `L2A`).\n",
    "5. **Download Latest or All Tiles**:\n",
    "   - If `download_latest_only` is `True`, it selects the latest processed image for each product type.\n",
    "   - If `download_latest_only` is `False`, it prepares to download all filtered images.\n",
    "6. **Download Files**: The function iterates through the filtered DataFrame and downloads each file, saving it to the specified folder.\n",
    "7. **Log Downloaded Files**: It logs the IDs of the downloaded files into a CSV file.\n",
    "8. **Error Handling**: The function includes error handling for network requests and file downloads.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Breakdown of Components\n",
    "\n",
    "- 👉 **S2X**: Satellite identifier\n",
    "  - `S2A` indicates the Sentinel-2A satellite.\n",
    "  - `S2B` indicates the Sentinel-2B satellite.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 👉 **MSILX**: Processing level and product type\n",
    "  - `MSI` stands for MultiSpectral Instrument.\n",
    "  - `L1C` indicates Level-1C processing (top-of-atmosphere reflectance).\n",
    "  - `L2A` indicates Level-2A processing (bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance).\n",
    "\n",
    "- 👉 **YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS**: Sensing start date and time\n",
    "  - `YYYYMMDD` is the date in the format YearMonthDay.\n",
    "  - `THHMMSS` is the time in the format HourMinuteSecond (UTC).\n",
    "\n",
    "- 👉 **NXXXX**: Baseline number\n",
    "  - `NXXXX` indicates the processing baseline number. A larger number means a more up-to-date version of the processing software.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 👉 **RXXX**: Relative orbit number\n",
    "  - `RXXX` indicates the relative orbit number.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 👉 **TXXXXX**: Tile identifier\n",
    "  - `TXXXXX` specifies the tile in the Military Grid Reference System (MGRS).\n",
    "\n",
    "- 👉 **YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS**: Product generation date and time\n",
    "  - `YYYYMMDD` is the date in the format YearMonthDay.\n",
    "  - `THHMMSS` is the time in the format HourMinuteSecond (UTC).\n",
    "\n",
    "- 👉 **.SAFE**: Folder extension\n",
    "  - `.SAFE` indicates that the folder contains Sentinel-2 data in the Standard Archive Format for Europe (SAFE).\n",
    "\n",
    "When images are requested, there may be instances where an image has several baseline numbers (e.g., N0300, N0500, N9999). Generally, a larger baseline number means a more up-to-date version.

    "### 📌 Example\n",
    "In this scenario:\n",
    "- If `download_latest_only=False`, both images will be downloaded.\n",

    "This code records the start and end times of a data download process, calculates the elapsed time, and prints the start time, end time, and elapsed time. It downloads the filtered datasets and saves them to the specified folder. Additionally, it logs the downloaded file IDs to a CSV file. This CSV file is useful to avoid repeating the download process if the operation was terminated (e.g., loss of connection). You can also write a code that reads the CSV file and skips these image IDs within your timeframe.\n",
